Note: If creating your own admin website, make sure to change the base url in the validation code in the first function of ufid_reader/UFIDReader/Packages/Validation/validation.py \
Note: When setting the mode to 1 or exam mode as a parameter in the validate function, there is no 15 minute time buffer whereas the regular mode has it. 

## Public Course API
### Credit: 
[Rob Olsthoorn UF API](https://github.com/Rolstenhouse/uf_api?tab=readme-ov-file#courses)
### How to Use:
**Base URL:**
\[GET\] https://one.ufl.edu/apix/soc/schedule/[parameters] \
Note: term and category are required. lastcontrolnumber is highly suggested \
\
Sample Call (Bare Minimum): \
https://one.ufl.edu/apix/soc/schedule/?category=RES&term=20165 \
\
**Parameters:** \
Appended to the BaseURL as parameter=value1&parameter2=value2 ... \
\
**Program/Category (Required)**
RES: Campus/Web/Special Program (Regular) (For Summer 2018 and before) \
CWSP: Campus/Web/Special Program (Regular) (Fall 2018 and beyond) \
UFO: UF online program \
IA: Innovation Academy \
HUR: USVI and Puerto Rico \
\
**Semester/Term (Required)** \
term = \[Year(with second digit removed\]\[Semester number\]\[optional Summer Semester\] \
Spring: 1 \
Summer: 5 (Append 6W1 for A. 6W2 for B. 1 for C) \
Fall: 8 \
\
Example: Summer A 2024 would be 22456W1; Fall 2024 would be 2248 \
\
**Number of Results** \
The JSON response from the API includes the last control number, retrieved rows, and total number of rows as of the results as \
\[ \
&nbsp;{ \
&nbsp;&nbsp;"COURSES":[ ], \
&nbsp;&nbsp;"LASTCONTROLNUMBER": \[number\] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;"RETRIEVEDROWS": \[number\] \
&nbsp;&nbsp;"TOTALROWS": \[number\] \
&nbsp;} \
\] \
\
This API limits the number of returned courses. In order to get the next set of results you must set last-control-number= the previous last-control-number. \
\
Example: Using last-control-number=0 along with the required parameters gets you the course results along with LASTCONTROLNUMBER: \[50\], you can then set last-control-number=50 to get the next set of results \
\
**Course Code** \
course-code=eel3135 This parameter lets you pass the course code as a parameter \
\
**Class Number/Section** \
class-num=12345 This parameter lets you pass the class/section number as a parameter \
\
**Meeting Days** \
"day-m": 'true', \
"day-t": 'false', \
"day-w": 'false', \
"day-r": 'false', \
"day-f": 'false', \
"day-s": 'false' \
Note: The days are NOT set as booleans but as strings of 'true' or 'false'. It is supposed to be lowercased. 
\
## API-to-Database.py (UFIDReader/Packages/Validation):
### Instructions
1. Pip install requests if you have not already
2. Run the python file
3. The file will prompt for an input of the semester in the format of year and semester. Input the year without the second digit (e.g 2024 is 224) then the semester (1 for spring, 5 for summer, 8 for fall). For summer A, B, or C you have to append 6W1, 6W2, or 1 respectively to the 5. This is the same way semesters/terms are set in the publicly available course API. (e.g. 2248 for Fall 2024 or 22456W1 for Summer A 2024)
4. The number of sections loaded will be shown as they are loaded in. Once all are loaded in a success message will be shown and a SQL database named courses_{term}.db will be created. A json file will also be created for the use of professor accounts in the professor website. This file contains sections sorted into their respective course code and name then sorted by instructors creating a hierarchical structure of instructors > course code and name > section number. In addition to this, an exams_{term}.db file will also be created with the course code, name, instructors, sections, and empty fields for the room, date, start time, and end time.  
5. Place the courses_{term}.db and exams_{term}.db in the /data folder for the admin website and place the json file in the professor website. Also make sure to update the app.py file, specifically the part where COURSE_DATA and EXAM_DATA is set based on the database files, so that it is pulling from the new course_{term}.db file and new exam_{term}.db file.
**Note: This should be updated every semester as course data chages** \

## System Test Checklist
1. Check that power and internet is connected to Kiosk.
2. Check that internet and website are functioning
3. Check that the MRD5 scanner is powered up by pressing the power on button which lights up and makes a beeping noise when turned on.
4. Check that required encryption packages (SQLcipter3-binary, python-dotenv) are installed and that the key provided is the correct encryption key. 
5. Check that the data for the courses and exams is up to date. 
6. Check the serial number in the kiosk database matches that of the device used. In this case a Rasp Pi 4.
7. Check that the room associated with the kiosk is the room that it is actually in or that you want to simulate it being in. Like 'NSC215'.
8. Check that the student is in the roster with the correct ISO and UFID
9. If an exam check that it is set to the correct room, date, and time.
10. Check that the section associated with the student in the roster is happening in the time range of the course within 15 before and after, on the day the class is usually, and in the room that is usually in. If an exam check that section associated with the student is associated with a course that has a exam in the time range with no buffer, on the date, and in the room of the exam.
11. Check that the mode parameter in the validate function is set to 1 for exam mode and any other number for regular mode. Though 0 should be commonly used for regular mode.  

## Gator Check In Site Professor Version (Hosted on PythonAnywhere)
Gator Check In is a web application that allows professors to manage timesheets created when UFIDs are scanned on the raspberry pi, therefore getting a better gage on student attendance. In theory, admins will have an account that gives an overview of students marked present for their courses only. They have the option of filtering through that data to return specific students, dates, section numbers, and course ids to find what they are looking for.
### Features
- Accounts: These keep track of the courses each professor teaches with login authentication
- Course and Section management: Professors have their courses organized for them, in which each course card will display timesheet daata for only that course. (Additional accounts set for creation for beta build)
- Attendance Tracking: Professors can track student attendance, taken from the backend, for all of their courses and section numbers. This application supports filtering of attendance records by date, course number, section number, and student name (plan to change to UFID in beta build). (Implemented for alpha build)
- Responsive design: This application works across different screen devices, though there is room for improvement in layout adaptability. (Implemented for alpha build)

## Gator Check In Admin Site (Hosted on PythonAnywhere)
GatorUFID or GatorCheck is a web application that allows for database hosting, data manipulation, data visualization, and kiosk configuration. In the validation code hosted on the RaspPi the website is used as an API to verify and save data. For teachers, admins, or IT the website serves to visualize this data in tables, manipulate the data with buttons and forms, and also download data. For the member of this project or for those who want to replicate it the website serves as a tool to easily add test data to the database. 

### Features
- Accounts: Basic admin login capability is implemented with sessions for data security.
- Student Form: Adds or edits student data in student table in roster database.
- Roster Page: Displays student data (UFID, ISO, Name, and Classes) and has Student Form to add more data. Also contains delete buttons for each entry as well as search bar.
- Timesheet Page: Display timesheet data (UFID, ISO, Name, Course, Class, Instructor, Room, and Time). Also contains delete all for debugging purposes and a search bar.
- Kiosks Page: Displays kiosk data (serial number and room number) and ability to add, edit, delete, and search for kiosks.
- Page Navigation

### Website API Endpoints
- GET /kiosks/\[serial_num\]
  - Retrieves room number associated with kiosk
- GET /roster/\[serial_num\]\[ufid or iso\]
  - Retrieves UFID, ISO, first name, last name, and class numbers associated with UFID or ISO
  - Both serial_num and ufid or iso are required to get an actual result
- GET /courses/\[day\]\[roomCode\]
  - Retrieves code, classNumber, instructor(s), meetNo, meetDay, meetTimeBegin, meetTimeEnd, and meetRoomCode associated with that day and room
  - Both day and roomCode are required to get an actual result
  - 'day' can be M, T, W, R, F, or S
  - Ex. roomCode: 'NSC215'
- GET /exams/\[serial_num\]\[date\]
  - Retrieves course code, class number, instructor(s), sections, room code, date, start time, and end time associated with that date and room (which it finds using the serial number and kiosk database)
  - Both serial_num and date are required to get an actual result
- POST /timesheet\[serial_num\]\[ufid\]\[iso\]\[first_name\]\[last_name\]\[course\]\[class\]\[instructor\]\[room_num\]\[time\]
  - Uses serial_num to verify authorized device by checking it exist in the PiConfig table in the database
  - Saves ufid, iso, first name, last name, course code, class/section number, instructor, room number, and time to timesheet table in database
 
### Encryption for Database Security

To ensure the database is securely encrypted, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages in PythonAnywhere's bash console:

```bash
pip install sqlcipher3-binary
pip install python-dotenv
```

The .env file contains hardcoded keys that are necessary for the encryption to work. The database in the GitHub directory is encrypted using this specific key. Using a different key will result in an error because the database cannot be decrypted without the exact key. For official deployment, ensure the .env file is excluded from the GitHub repository to maintain security.

The .env file must follow this format:

```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=#####################
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
**Note**: The variable names (ENCRYPTION_KEY and FLASK_SECRET_KEY) must remain exactly as shown, and no quotation marks should be used around the keys. Additionally, do not change the FLASK_SECRET_KEY, as doing so will cause the admin login to stop working.

To encrypt a new, unencrypted database, follow these steps:

1. Delete the existing encrypted database.
2. Add the unencrypted database file to the appropriate directory.
3. Update the encryption key in the `.env` file.

**Recommendation**: Save a copy of the unencrypted database for backup purposes before proceeding. The unencrypted database will be overridden and encrypted using the key specified in the .env file.

3. Re-run the website to complete the encryption process for the new database.

### Instructions for Admin Site
1. If you want to replicate the app do the following, else if you just want access to the website go to the link https://gatorufid.pythonanywhere.com (to get to admin page use login admin1 for both username and password)
2. Create pythonanywhere account
3. Create webapp and set backend to flask
4. Copy the UFIDWebapp folder into the mysite folder in the file tab (The api and uploads folder can be omitted)

\
**Main Work Completed (Beta Build and Alpha Test):**
* Software
   * Wrote program API-to-Database.py which utilized public course API to get all class sections for that semester and save them to a database
     * Database contains the code, classNumber, instructor(s), meetNo, meetDay, meetTimeBegin, meetTimeEnd, and meetRoomCode
     * Classes were saved using the class section and meeting number as a composite key
     * Allows custom API calls to be made, reducing lag by using new parameters to filter data before returning it
   * Made GET API endpoints for the website to access the student, kiosk, and course data from the kiosk (Details of API endpoints found above)
     * Courses GET endpoint reduces lag previously caused by calling public course API which had a lack of parameters leading to many result being returnned and manually filtered for

   * Wrote Unit Tests for the API GET request to the website
   * Wrote a time response test for public course API which analyzed how much time it took to receive and manually filter results given a day parameter. It also provided insight into how many sections and meeting times were loaded and the amount of results given a hardcoded time of 11 AM and a room code of NSC215. Note: No matter what time or room code were used, all meeting times of sections had to be iterated through. 
* Hardware
   * Created functioning system on the Pi 4 which reads a UFID and shows different frames based on program and validation statuses.
     * Uses tkinter to display a user interface.
     * Constantly polls for incoming UFID scan, with four different frames currently: request, loading, success, and failure.
     * Communicates with the database website to determine if an incoming UFID is valid.
     * Performs in an infinite loop, allowing for any number of potential scans without need for recalibration or interaction.
   * Tested Pi 4 core temperature during operation to see if normal use can cause overheating. Exported results to csv for further analysis.
   * Measured the average time the system took for a full iteration, starting at the time a UFID is scanned, and ending when the result frame is displayed. Exported results to csv for further analysis.
   * Adjusted tkinter configuration to allow the display to work correctly on differently sized monitors.

### End Goal Project Architecture:
#### External Interface
Users will interface with a MRD5 scanner and LCD screen. The MRD5 scanner will take in input from either the magnetic stripe of a physical card or the NFC tap of a physical or mobile card. The validation of the ID will be displayed on screen (error, not in roster, present, etc.) along with the name and photo of the student. For admins, teachers, and IT they will interface with a website allowing them to see and manipulate data. 
#### Persistent State
The UF directory and ESODBC data warehouse will be the persistent state in which information such as the student ISO, name, ID number, photo, and class number of enrolled course can be accessed. Another database hosted on a UF server will be used to store the timestamp and Pi/Kiosk configuration data. This server could also host the website. Course data is available in one of the UF servers and can be accessed with a publicly available API. 
#### Internal System
The internal system will use its serial number to send a get request to the database with Pi/Kiosks configurations to get the room it is in. Using the time and room it will send another get request to the course database to find class numbers happening at that time in that room. It will also take in the input of the physical or mobile ID and request information related to the ISO or UFID number. It will then check if the class number of the student match that of the class numbers related to the ID. If the ID is valid it will be timestamped, sent to the database, and outputted to the LCD. If invalid it will also be outputted with some error message. 
#### Communication Structures
External communication to database with secure internet connection and API request with data being encrypted. Internal communication between microcontroller and MRD5 scanner with USB and communication between microcontroller and LCD screen with some type of HDMI. 
#### Integrity and Resiliance
Data validation code will be written to ensure that the input is valid with regards to fitting the 8 digit student ID or unique ISO number format. It will also be checked in terms of existing in the student database as stated in the internal system section. Sensitive data will also encrypted before being sent through API requests and requests for sensitive data will need authorized device checked with the serial number of the kiosks in the Pi/Kiosks database. 
## Bugs/Issues
**Full and Detailed List of Bugs/Issues:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LEbZKjoLoHLEzeAZ4qlOMeJ4DfzlMnsj3Ypd5segmE/edit?usp=sharing \
\
**Assumptions/Bugs/Issues Remaining (Production Release and Post-Mortem):**
* Assumptions
  * Data would come from UF's Database so it would be complete and valid
    * Database access was not granted
    * Using a Public Course API the course data is the only data actually from UF
    * All other data is created with the knowledge of what UF's Database contains and what is needed for the system to function
  * Student information will be collected and updated from students voluntarily through a form or for the purpose of testing, dummy data can be generated
    * This is due to FERPA laws
    * Both function assumes that information given or created is acurate
  * Stable internet and power is provided to the system
    * Without connection to the internet the system cannot communicate with the databases hosted on the website 
  * Exam information is updated after confering with the registrar
    * Since there is not formal system for reserving rooms, instructor should confer with the registrar and update the date, time, and room of the exam on the website 
  * Website information will be updated each semester
    * In order for attendence to be validated accurately the course data needs to be updated using the API-to-Database.py code
    * The rosters also need to be reset for students to enter their information or just updated if access to UF database is granted
    * Instructor/professor ownership of course will also have to be update likely using the API-to-Database.py code
  * Kiosk room data will be updated if moved
    * In the Kiosk tab of the website, based on the serial number the kiosk's room can be changed
* Bugs/Issues
  * Form for student data is inconvenient as anytime you need to update information you have to put in all the info again
    * This was done purposely as it was thought that students would provide this information and should not see or have access to other information
    * However, it is an inconvenience in testing and debugging
    * To fix this issue the form can stay on the login page still being accessed by the form tab but after logging in the roster table could have editable fields like the rest of the table
  * Button was not developed so mode has to be manually edited
    * This can be done in UFIDReader/src/main.py by changing the parameter to 1 for mode in the validate function which is called in the process_scan function
  * Exams search filter latency
    * Due to the amount of searchable fields for each course, the dynamic search filter takes a few seconds to show the results
  * Filter Breaks Pagination
    * When the filter/search bar is used, it breaks the pagination allowing more results than what is laid out in the pagination
    * To fix this issue, it might be a better idea to not do dynamic filtering but rather have a form which when submitted filters based on the fields entered.
  * Data is only encrypted at rest
    * Data is not encrypted in transit
    * Anyone who obtains the database file will not be able to access the information without the key
    * However, anyone who uses the API calls will be able to get the information since the routing decrypts the data
    * To fix this issue the data should be encrypted before being sent and decrypted when received
  * Kiosk frame latency
    * Response times range in speed from near instant to upwards of 4 seconds or more.
    * Variable due to the communication over the internet to the website database, not in processing speed on the Pi.
    * Not much to be done to speed this up, other than storing database info locally on the Pi, which might create security issues. 
\
**Main Bugs/Issues (Release Candidate and Beta Test):**
* Main loop not running
  * Print debugged and found problem to be unresolved error
  * Made sure errors returned response from website and that these responses were translated to the correct validity 0, -1 , -2, -3
* Using real time for validation code seems to not work
  * Print debugged and found to be no problem
  * Rather example tested with was the class section associated with CEN4908C which occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the real-time was a Monday
  * Adding a class section which meets on Monday to a student in the roster database and changing the room associated with the kiosk to the room of the new class that happens on Monday at that time fixes the issue and the student is valid.
* There is no validation for exams
  * Contacted UFIT, Dr. Blanchard, and Carsten to gain knowledge about the system
  * Created the basic structure missing API request to a not yet existing database of exam room reservations
  * Planning to create API request and database for exams
* Case for Rasp Pi too small
  * Made arms holding MRD5 higher so it would fit
  * Made the box wider and longer so the wires would fit
  * Made the wire holes deeper so they wouldn’t need to bend as much
  * Moved the mount holes lower so the SD card on the Rasp Pi would have clearance
* Program which takes course data and sorts it in json file by instructor, course, then section isn’t saving and has duplicates
  * “f” used so that {term} would be recognized as a variable
  * Duplicates removed by using sets instead

**Main Bugs/Issues (Beta Build and Alpha Test):**
* Kiosks page can be accessed without login. Note: only temp form page can be seen at time of bug.
  *  Fixed by integrating sessions in Kiosks page app routing
* Sessions not ending after tab or window exited
  *  Fixed using beforeunload listener along with navigation flag
  *  Navigation flag ensures that session is only exited when tab closed and not when page is changed
* Logout button on roster page not displaying properly
  * Fixed with display: inline-block instead of inline
* Kiosk form submit button kicks user out of session
  * Form changed to table and no longer has submit button which kicks users out
* Session kicks out after refreshing twice
  * Session time out after 15 minutes of inactivity instead now not relying on beforeunload listener or navigation flags
* Validation code produces unexpected output sometimes returning an error and other times the UFID, Name, and Validity
  * Fixed by returning the UFID, Name, and Validity each time but with the validity being 0, -1, -2, -3 instead of a boolean. With the errors being converted to a -1, -2, or -3 validity representing serial number not found, UFID or ISO not found, and no matching class, respectively.
* Incorrect output of validation function when cards sequentially scanned
  * Tested validation function for output (Worked as expected)
  * Fixed by clearing input using strip after each scan.
* Lag in validation caused by lack of parameters for public course API
  * Wrote API-to-Database.py program (similar to CourseFetch.py) to take data relating to a semester from the public course API and save it to a database
  * Hosted new course database on website in /data folder

\
**Main Bugs/Issues (Alpha Build):**
* Rasp Pi 4 display resolution too small on monitor
  *  Commandline still appears small but display of the GUI can be adapted to take up the whole screen
* Publicly available course API has inaccurate information with regards to the total rows returned
  *  Fixed by receiving data until all was there was no more
* Publicly available course API not on whitelist of website on free version of pythonanywhere so it doesn't work
  *  Running course API on RaspPi instead of website
  *  Also, is closer to ideal design where everything but the databases are on the RaspPi and to get info the RaspPi is making API request to the website or course API
* Course API needs year and semester to obtain course data for the desired semester
  *  Programmed a HTML parser to parse for start and end dates from the academic calendar
  *  First used on website but did not work due to whitelist of websites
  *  Likely reutilized now that access to course API can be done from RaspPi      
* Lacking permanent hosting and effient way to visualize and edit data
  *  Created website on pythonanywhere to host database and easily manipulate and visualize data
* Website Form / Web Database Issues   
  * No way to add to data to student database besides hardcoding it or commandline
  * Website form doesn't restrict class data to existing data and allows overwriting which is okay for updating but has the possibility of writing over other students data unitentionally.  
  * ISO is not know by student unless they tap their card or mobile device
    *  Created a form on the new website with the assumption that at the beginning of the year students would manually input there own info
    *  Attempted to use publicly available course API to restrict course/class options though it is not on the whitelist of website allowed on the free version of pythonanywhere
    *  Attempted to get MRD5 scanner reconfigured so that only UFID is received from swipe or tap so ISO is not needed
    *  Now operating under the ideal assumption that student and course data is provided in UF database and will therefore be taken from there instead of provided by students
    *  Using form for testing purposes and easy way to edit data 
* No UF Database Access
  *  Denied UF database access due to FERPA
  *  Switched pseudo-database to be hosted on a pythonanywhere website as closest to ideal solution simulating the UF database servers
  *  Utilized publically available API for courses
  *  Created table in database for student info, RaspPi configurations, and time-stamp data
  *  Inquired UFIT about the type of database (SQL) and what data headings were on the database
* Internet
  * Raspi4 disconnects from EDUROAM wifi on startup and does not allow communication with website/database
  * Solution for now is to use ethernet connection to facilitate communication
* Threading
  * GUI thread blocks input from accessing parsing thread
  * Current solution will be to take input directly from USB connection instead of from console  

\
**Main Bugs/Issues (Design Prototype):**
* Rasp Pi 4 display resolution too small on monitor
  * Kept the same for now 
* Reading HID data from MRD5 scanner directly not working
  * Switched from Rasp Pi 2040 to Rasp Pi 4
  * Used python input() function
* Client-Server communication between Rasp Pi 4 and Server device via TCP/IP using sockets
  *  Switched port number
  *  Used ipconfig command on server device to set ip address for connection
* No Database Access
  *  Denied UF database access due to FERPA
  *  Switched from using csv pseudo-database to SQLite pseudo-database hosted on a server device
  *  Created csv for time-stamp data hosted on server device
  *  Attempt to get indirect access to the database structure
  *  Attempt to host server on CISE server
* GUI connection to Rasp Pi 4
  * Fixed using python tkinter

\
**Main Bugs/Issues (Pre-Alpha):**
* MRD5 scanner not outputting via HID
  * Fixed by obtaining correctly configured MRD5 scanner.
* No database access
  * In process of obtaining access.
  * Temporarily will configure similar pseudo-database for easy code adaptation when access is granted.
* Cannot read MRD5 scanner data using Pico
  * In process of fixing issue.
